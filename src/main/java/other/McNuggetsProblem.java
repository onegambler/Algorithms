/**
 * A McNugget number is a positive integer that can be obtained by adding together orders of McDonald'sÂ®
 * Chicken McNuggetsTM (prior to consuming any), which originally came in boxes of 6, 9, and 20.
 * Given an integer K, determine if it can be represented in a sum of different boxes.
 *
 * Examples
 * 3 -> NO: no boxes can give you only three nuggets
 * 6 -> YES: one box of size 6
 * 12 -> YES: two boxes of size 6
 * 15 -> NO: you ca reach 12 with 2 boxes but you have 3 left
 * 26 -> YES: one box of size 20 and one of size 6
