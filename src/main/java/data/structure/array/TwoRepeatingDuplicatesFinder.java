/**
 * Find the two repeating elements in a given data.structure.array.
 * You are given an data.structure.array of n+2 elements. All elements of the data.structure.array are in range 1 to n.
 * And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
 *
 * For example, data.structure.array = {4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1} and n = 5
 * The above data.structure.array has n + 2 = 7 elements with all elements occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice.
 * So the output should be 4 2.
